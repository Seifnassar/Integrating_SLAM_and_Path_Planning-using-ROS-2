# Integrating_SLAM_and_Path_Planning-using-ROS-2

This project implements a complete indoor navigation system for a differential drive robot using **Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**. The system integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), global path planning with A*, and motion control through a state feedback controller. The TurtleBot3 Burger robot is used within the Gazebo simulator, with RViz providing real-time visualization and interaction.

## üß† Project Overview

The system is designed to:
- Create a 2D occupancy grid map (Cartographer)
- Localize the robot in the map (AMCL)
- Plan global paths using A* algorithm
- Control the robot using a unicycle-model-based state feedback controller

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **SLAM with Cartographer**: builds a 2D map using LIDAR and odometry.
- ‚úÖ **Localization with AMCL**: custom implementation using particle filtering.
- ‚úÖ **Global Path Planning with A***: safe, optimized path generation.
- ‚úÖ **Motion Control**: smooth path tracking using a state feedback controller.
- ‚úÖ **Simulation Support**: tested in Gazebo with RViz visualization.

## üéØ Localization with AMCL

AMCL uses a particle filter to estimate the robot's position based on laser scans and odometry:
